# rad

`rad` is a programming enviroment and a text editor. You could say that it is
a bunch of functions to manipulate a data structure I call 'buffer'.
If you know what a rad buffer is, you know everything there is to know about `rad`.

* A `rad` buffer is a list of lines.

* Lines are vectors of chars.

A buffer can look like this:

```
[       ;; A buffer is a list of line
  [     ;; A line is a list of chars
    \r  ;; A char
    \a
  ]
  [
    \d
    \!
  ]
]
```
When rendering this, it will look like this
```
ra
d!
```
And that is pretty radical.

## Usage

At the moment it does not do very much. If you want to run the program, follow these steps:

1. Have JVM installed. Tested with JVM 1.7 & 1.8.
2. Have [`lein`](http://leiningen.org) installed.
3. In this projects root, run `lein run`

At this stage, the program can only edit one buffer (an atom saved at `rad.buffer/current-buffer`).
You can insert characters, make newlines (with Enter) and delete characters with backspace.

The next step is to implement the package system, which have the same features, but be radically simpler (and leaning closer to immutability) than Emacs modes, Atom packages, Vim scripts & Eclipse plugins. More on this in the next release :). 

## Why?

I was a `vim` person for the longest time. Then I got sucked into Lisp and `emacs`.
I was also jealous of the swiftness of Sublime Text and the many nifty features
of various IDEs.

`rad` is not much more than a few loose ideas at the moment - and it might never
become anything worthwhile. My hope though, is to make a text editor that is
line-based (like `vim`). Therefore, the data structure of a buffer in `rad`
is line-based, unlike `emacs` buffers (where line numbers (`linum-mode`) are expensive).

It is also written in [Clojure](http://clojure.org). I hope to make it
better performing than `emacs`, thanks to Clojures `core.async` and easy
to use `go`-blocks. I also have an idea about wrapping each render-line (will be there in the future!) in a call to `memoize`, and maybe making the editor orders of magnitudes faster at interactive editing. 

Last but not least, I hope to let it feel modern. You should be able
to use `rad` with you keyboard only, but it should have 'normal' keyboard
shortcuts (ctrl-c for copy to system clipboard, ctrl-z for undo, etc).

That is still far in the future, though.
